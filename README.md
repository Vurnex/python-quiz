# Python Quiz

A project that prompts a user with questions on Python and other things computer related. The correct answers are given to the user at the end. 

This was a group project completed in Fall 2019 while taking my IT Degree. The group consisted of three people. My role in the project was coming up with the questions and adding the code for them. The other two members handled the logic and functions.

Since this was a first year programming class, there were some small things that could have been done better. I fixed up the formatting of the text and added a bit more input validation to some functions.
